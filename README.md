# JM Project

A smart ride-sharing platform where users can register as drivers or passengers, share their routes or requests, and get matched based on real-time location, vehicle type, and proximity. JM Project is designed for seamless and efficient ride matching with a user-friendly interface.

## ‚úÖ Ride Progress & History:
